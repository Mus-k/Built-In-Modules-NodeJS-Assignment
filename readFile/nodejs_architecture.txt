Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime and follows an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient for building scalable network applications.

Additional Advantages of Node.js:

1. Single-threaded, non-blocking I/O: Node.js is designed to be single-threaded and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for handling concurrent operations.

2. Large ecosystem: Node.js has a rich ecosystem of modules and packages available through npm (Node Package Manager), which facilitates easy integration of third-party libraries.

3. Fast execution: The V8 JavaScript engine used by Node.js is known for its high-performance, making Node.js suitable for building fast and scalable applications.
